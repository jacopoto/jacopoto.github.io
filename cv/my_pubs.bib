  abstract = {Abstract The increasing flow of immigrants into Europe over the last decade has generated a range of considerations in the policy agenda of many receiving countries. One of the main considerations for policymakers and public opinion alike is whether immigrants contribute their ‘fair’ share to their host country's tax and welfare system. In this paper, we assess the net fiscal impact of intra-EU and extra-EU migration in 27 European Union (EU) Member States. We find that migrants in the EU, on average, contribute more than natives to welfare states. However, when we take an age-specific life-cycle perspective, we find that natives generally show a higher net fiscal contribution than both groups of migrants. Among migrants, extra-EU migrants contribute less than intra-EU migrants. We then use a demographic microsimulation model to project the potential net fiscal impact of migration in the EU into the future. We show that despite the fact that intra-EU migration contributes to reduce the strong negative impact of population ageing, its contribution is not sufficient to offset the negative fiscal consequences.}

Motivated by the growing evidence on the unequal economic impact of this crisis across genders, we study if the unequal economic burden has induced different support to public authorities between men and women. While the support for national governments has overall faded in the period considered. the decline has been more pronounced for women and working women in particular. We find indication that the decline in support signals a shift in concerns among Europeans and European women in particular, from the health emergency to the economic consequences of the pandemic. We impute up to a third of the widening gender gap in support for government to the shift of emphasis from the health to the economic dimension of the crisis.}",

This is not explained by differences in selection into employment, economic conditions at graduation, or field of study choices. Graduates who enrol in bad times are not more positively selected based on their high-school outcomes, but they achieve higher college grades and earn higher wages conditional on their grades. Patterns for female graduates are similar, though less robust. Our results suggest that individuals who enrol during downturns exert more effort during their studies.}",

abstract = {Summary Returns to education are variable both within and between educational group. If uncertain pay-offs are a concern to individuals when selecting an education, wage variance is relevant. The variation is a combination of unobserved heterogeneity and pure uncertainty or risk. The first element is known to the individual, but unknown to the researcher; the second is unknown to both. As a result, the variance of wages observed in the data will overestimate the real magnitude of educational uncertainty and the effect that risk has on educational decisions. We apply a semiparametric estimation technique to tackle the selectivity issues. This method does not rely on distributional assumptions of the errors in the schooling choice and wage equations. Our results suggest that risk is decreasing in schooling. Private information accounts for a share varying between 0\% and 13\% of total wage variance observed depending on the educational level. Finally, we conclude that the estimation results are very sensitive to the functional relation that is imposed on the error structure.},
