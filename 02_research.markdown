  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Using data for nearly 40 cohorts of American college graduates and exploiting regional variation in economic conditions, we show robust evidence of a positive relationship between the unemployment rate at the time of college enrollment and subsequent annual earnings, particularly for women. This positive relationship cannot be explained by selection into employment or by economic conditions at the time of labor market entry. Up to one quarter of the effect is accounted for by changes in field of study choices and by sorting towards more remunerative locations. The results are consistent with a behavioral change that induces individuals who experience bad economic times at the beginning of their studies to exert more effort towards obtaining higher-paying jobs.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

The increasing flows of immigrants in Europe over the last decade has generated a range of considerations in the policy agenda of many receiving countries. One of the main considerations for policy makers and public opinions alike is whether immigrants contribute their "fair" share to their host country tax and welfare system. This paper seeks to answer this question based on an empirical assessment of the net fiscal contributions of immigrants in the 27 EU Member States using EUROMOD, a EU-wide tax-benefit microsimulation model. In addition to the traditional view of the tax-benefit system, we add indirect taxation and in-kind benefits to the analysis of net contributions. Our findings highlight that migrants on average contributed about 250 euro per year more than natives to the welfare state in 2015. However, when we take an average age-specific life-cycle perspective, we find that natives generally show a higher net fiscal contribution than both, intra-EU and extra-EU migrants, while extra-EU migrants contribute on average less than intra-EU migrants.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

We provide a first systematic assessment of the labor market impact of COVID-19 on immigrant workers in Europe. In the first year of the pandemic, we estimate that Extra EU migrants were twice as likely to have their job terminated relative to comparable natives, while for EU migrants this probability was 1.6 times larger. To understand the determinants of these large gaps, we focus on three job characteristics: essentiality, temporariness and teleworkability. After documenting differential migrant-native distribution along these three dimensions, we estimate that this pre-pandemic occupational sorting accounts for around 50% of the explained native-migrants gaps in the risk of employment termination; sorting into industries accounts for the other half. Further, we estimate a larger penalty for migrants from being employed in low-teleworkable occupations. Even within narrow occupation/industry cells, however, more than half of the migrant-native gap in job separation probability remains unexplained.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

We investigate the major choice of college graduates where we make choice dependent on expected initial wages and expected wage growth per major. We build a model that allows us to estimate these factors semiparametrically and that corrects for selection bias. We estimate the model on the combined NLSY79 and NLSY97 samples. We find markedly different results in expected real wage growth and expected initial wages across majors. Furthermore, the differences in these expectations appear to be relevant for major choice.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Using data covering most European Union Member States, we study how the support for national governments has unravelled in the first months of the COVID pandemic. Motivated by the growing evidence on the uneven economic impact of this crisis across genders, we study if such unequal economic burden is related to differences in support for public authorities between men and women. While the support for national governments has overall faded in the period considered, the decline has been more pronounced for women, and working women in particular. We find indication that the decline in support signals a shift in concerns among Europeans, and women in particular, from the health emergency to the economic consequences of the pandemic. We impute up to a third of the widening gender gap in support for government to the shift of emphasis from the health to the economic dimension of the crisis.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

We show that cohorts of male graduates who start college during worse economic times earn higher average wages than those who start during better times. This is not explained by differences in selection into employment, economic conditions at graduation, or field of study choices. Graduates who enrol in bad times are not more positively selected based on their high-school outcomes, but they achieve higher college grades and earn higher wages conditional on their grades. Patterns for female graduates are similar, though less robust. Our results suggest that individuals who enrol during downturns exert more effort during their studies.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Returns to education are variable both within and between educational group. If uncertain payoffs are a concern to individuals when selecting an education, wage variance is relevant. The variation is a combination of unobserved heterogeneity and pure uncertainty or risk. The first element is known to the individual, but unknown to the researcher, the second is unknown to both. As a result, the variance of wages observed in the data will overestimate
the real magnitude of educational uncertainty and the impact that risk has on educational decisions. In this paper we apply a semiparametric estimation technique to tackle the selectivity issues. This method does not rely on distributional assumptions of the errors in the schooling choice and wage equations. Our results suggest that risk is decreasing in schooling. Private information accounts for a share varying between 0% and 13% of total wage variance observed depending on the educational level. Finally, we conclude that the estimation results are very sensitive to the functional relation imposed on the error structure.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

We apply a recently proposed method to disentangle unobserved heterogeneity from risk in returns to education to data for the USA, the UK and Germany. We find that in residual wage variation, uncertainty by far dominates unobserved heterogeneity. The relation between uncertainty and level of education is not monotonic and differs among countries.
