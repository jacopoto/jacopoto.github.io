# step 1: transform into a list
pp <- plotly::plotly_build(p)

# step 2: loop over pp$x$data, and change the font size of all text elements to 28
for(i in seq_along(pp$x$data)){

:::

    -   Your instrument is endogenous
    -   External validity of your experiment
    -   Using DiD? Oh boy...
    :::

-   Work hard on the first 10 minutes of the presentation. Ideally, you need to entice all members of staff.

:::

## The Application Package

::: panel-tabset
### The Job Market Paper

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   The most important piece of your application;
-   Generally single-authored (increasingly co-authored, but only if with another student);
-   Showcases your best effort;
-   Recommendations:
    -   Work on your introduction again, and again, and again...and then some more.
    -   Ask for feedback on it from anyone you can.
:::

### CV

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Recommendations:
    -   Pick a clear, clean template, no matter what format (e.g. .tex/.doc/.rmd).
    -   Ask someone to go through it to check for clarity.
    -   Carefully select the information to include.
    -   Go for relevance, not length.
:::

### Letters of Recommendation

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Generally 2/3
-   Your main advisor is expected to be one of them
-   Only academic referees
-   Recommendations:
    -   Give ample time to letter writers
    -   Ask people who know your work well
    -   If you can, get a letter from someone outside U.S.E.
:::

### Cover Letter

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   1-page letter where you substantiate your interest in the position
-   Arguably **not** the most important piece of the package
-   Recommendations:
    -   Do not repeat the CV
    -   Fine to have a standard template (but please change Institution and recipient's names)
    -   Taylor only when you have something specific to say about that specific application
:::

### Miscellaneous

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Course evaluations
-   Research statement
-   Teaching statement
:::
