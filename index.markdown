### Hi,

I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford, [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner#/){:target="_blank"} and at the [Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner/){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on labour market policies. I am studying the reasons for slow wage growth in Europe, conducting a randomised control trial on a [pilot job guarantee scheme](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/Marienthal/){:target="_blank"} and have founded the [Oxford Supertracker: The Global Directory of COVID Policy Trackers and Surveys](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. 

My work has been featured by CNN, the Financial Times, Forbes and Nature among other outlets. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a Young Associate Economist at the OECD Economics Department in Paris and as a Junior Economist at the International Labour Organization in Geneva.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:lukas.lehner@spi.ox.ac.uk) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/LukasLehner_){:target="_blank"}.
