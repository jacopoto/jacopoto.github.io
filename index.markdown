### Hi,

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford, [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner#/){:target="_blank"} and at the [Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner/){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on labour market policies. I am studying the reasons for slow wage growth in Europe, conducting a randomised control trial on a [pilot job guarantee scheme](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/Marienthal/){:target="_blank"} and have founded the [Oxford Supertracker: The Global Directory of COVID Policy Trackers and Surveys](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. 

My research has been featured by the Financial Times, CNN, Forbes and Nature among others, and has been awarded the Barnett Prize for the best paper at DSPI, University of Oxford. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a Young Associate Economist at the OECD Economics Department in Paris and as a Junior Economist at the International Labour Organization in Geneva.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:lukas.lehner@spi.ox.ac.uk) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/LukasLehner_){:target="_blank"}.
