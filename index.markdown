### Hi,

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford, [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner#/) and at the [Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner/).

My focus is on labour market policies. I apply comparative, microeconometric and experimental methods to explore the political causes of employment policies and how they affect unemployment, wages and inequality across Europe.

As part of my research, I conduct a randomised control trial on a [pilot job guarantee scheme](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/Marienthal/) and I have recently founded the [Oxford Supertracker: The Global Directory of COVID Policy Trackers and Surveys](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/). My work has been featured by CNN, the Financial Times, and Nature among other outlets.
