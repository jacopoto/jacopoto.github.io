### Hi,

I am an assistant professor at the [School of Economics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/utrecht-university-school-of-economics-use){:target="_blank"} of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en){:target="_blank"} .

I am mostly interested in issues related to migration and the economics of education and tertiary education in particular.

Before joining Utrecht University I was a Lecturer in Economics at the Universities of Manchester and Essex, and a Scientific Officer with the European Commission - Joint Research Centre.

 If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:jacmazza@gmail.com) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/JacopoMazza){:target="_blank"}.
