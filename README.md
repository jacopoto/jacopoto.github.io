This is the repository for my academic website: https://lukaslehner.github.io/.

I have summarised some advice on [tools to build your website using Markdown and Git](https://lukaslehner.github.io/assets/transparency-outreach-slides.html).

The initial website theme is based on *[Academic](https://github.com/gaalcaras/academic)* by [Gabriel Alcaras](https://gaalcaras.com/en/). I have implemented a number of adjustments that you can find in this repository.

My academic CV is written in Markdown and converted to LaTeX using Knit. The template and code is based on [Alex Albright](https://github.com/apalbright/CV) and [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/).

You can find more about my work on my [university webpage](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner/).
