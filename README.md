# jacopoto.github.io
This is the repository for my academic website: https://jacopoto.github.io/.

The initial website theme is based on *[Academic](https://github.com/gaalcaras/academic)* by [Gabriel Alcaras](https://gaalcaras.com/en/). The theme has been modified by [Lucas Lehner](https://lucaslehner.github.io/) who implemented a number of adjustments that you can find described in his [repository](https://github.com/lukaslehner/lukaslehner.github.io).
